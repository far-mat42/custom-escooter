--------------- ELECTRIC SCOOTER BUILD REQUIREMENTS ---------------
Criteria and Constraints:
- Top speed 30km/h 
	- Nice to have: "Turbo" option that increases top speed to 40km/h
	- Top speed determined on level ground, little to no headwind, and full throttle with max. 10 seconds to accelerate from 0
- Minimum 30km range (approx. 1 hour of continuous use)
- Adjustable speed via a throttle 
- Display to show power consumption/capacity remaining, speed, other info maybe
- Safety (mainly for the battery):
	- E-stop: Button to press that will disconnect the battery from the system
	- Temperature monitoring
	- Current and voltage monitoring
	- Cell balancing
		- Nice to have: Active cell balancing. Passive cell balancing is easier and less risky, but less efficient
- Capability to ride at night (interface is visible/can be made visible at night, can provide visibility at night)

List of high-level parts:
- Kick scooter (includes the frame, base, brakes, and steering)
- Battery
- BMS
- Motor
- Motor controller
- Control interface
- Lighting

High-to-Low Level Requirements (by part):
- Kick scooter:
	- Support weight of the rider, small cargo, and the added parts (battery, motor, electronics)
	- Manual brake system
	- Big, durable tires
- Battery:
	- Enough battery capacity to support full 30km range
	- High enough discharge rating to power the motor and auxiliary electronics
	- Cable connection provided for cell balancing
- BMS:
	- Custom PCB
	- Temperature, current and voltage monitoring
	- State of charge monitoring
	- Cell balancing (preferably active, but passive works too)
	- Telemetry with the display so relevant information is available to the rider
	- Capable of partially and fully disconnecting the battery from the rest of the system, in case of faults or emergencies 
		- Example scenarios: overcurrent, overtemperature, low battery/cell voltage, charge depleted 
	- Logging and log storage - log monitored values and save them so they can be accessed in case of emergency shutoff
- Motor:
	- Generate enough torque and power to achieve the top speed
	- Brushless DC motor (optimal efficiency, durability, and ease of maintenance)
- Motor controller:
	- Custom PCB
	- Research needed on how to make a BLDC motor controller - can talk to design team members
	- Control will probably be done with an Arduino or similar device
- Control interface:
	- Continuous throttle to control motor speed
	- Emergency stop and shut-off: Allow the rider to immediately disconnect the battery from the motor and/or the entire system
	- Status display via a display screen and/or LEDs
	- Discrete control for lights
- Lighting:
	- Forward and rear facing lights. Forward lights need to be bright enough to light the way
		- Nice to have: brake lights
