# Custom E-Scooter
In the process of developing my own custom electric scooter, with the goal of achieving 30km/h top speed and 1 hour battery life. 

So far, I've developed an architecture that involves a custom control interface using an Arduino Mega, a BLDC motor controller PCB to control a single motor drivetrain, a custom battery and BMS, a power regulation board for regulating the motor voltage and charging the battery, and other supporting components. Check out the full high-level design below!

Currently, I've designed the schematic & layout for a custom BLDC motor controller PCB, which will be tested with the actual motor soon. Additionally, I've completed the design and testing of a custom lithium-titanate (LTO) battery pack and BMS PCB. Check out the full design whitepaper and test results in the whitepaper linked below!
